# Welcome to DFOScouter!

This project is a personal project meant to accomplish two things:

- Create a complete working version of DFCat.net for the Global Server
- Practice NextJS and Django for myself

  DFO *does* have a DFCat equivalent in the form of DFO.gg. However, it has several functions that aren't complete just yet.

  This project aims to have all of those functionalities completed as well as provide practice.

  If you are seeing this and would like to contribute or provide guidance, please feel free to reach out to me at samkunkim@gmail.com
